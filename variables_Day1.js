// !Variables and Data Types:
// JavaScript allows you to store values using variables. You can declare variables using let, const, or var.


/* 
Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using cons*/

x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;

NOTE : It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.

// let: Used to declare variables that can change.
// const: Used for variables that should remain constant.
// var: An older way to declare variables (avoid using it in modern code).

// The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

// The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

// The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

var name = "John"; // String
const age = 25;    // Number
let isStudent = true;  // Boolean

Variables are containers for storing values.

JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter.
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
